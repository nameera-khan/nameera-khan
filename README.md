# ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Nameera Nilofer Khan
- ğŸ‘€ I am a graduate in data science and artificial intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. 
-  My interest in data science had begun during the final year of my undergraduate degree, which consequently pushed me toward pursuing a career in DS with a bigger picture. 
- ğŸŒ±  This is my portfolio for the projects I work on in my data science and machine learning journey.


Thank you for taking the time :D
