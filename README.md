# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Nameera Nilofer Khan
- ðŸ‘€ I am a recent graduate in data science and artificial intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. 
-  My interest in data science had begun during the final year of my undergraduate degree, which consequently also pushed me toward pursuing a career with a bigger picture. 
- ðŸŒ± I am here to use github as my portfolio for the projects I work in my data science journey. It is here to showcase my progress; success and not much of it alike. I am learning to tell stories with data in all its glory.
- The repositories displayed on my profile are for the purpose of self-learning and also the ones I have worked on during my study.

Thank you for taking the time :D
