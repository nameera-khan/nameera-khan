# 👋 Hi, I am Nameera Nilofer Khan
- 👀 I am a data scientist with a background in Data Science and AI. 
-  My interest in data science had begun during the final year of my undergraduate degree, which consequently pushed me toward pursuing a career in DS with a bigger picture.
-  My Github repository consists of a mixture of projects; from career paths that I find fascinating to dabbling into hobby areas like football analysis. 
- 🌱  This is my portfolio for the projects I work on in my data science and machine learning journey.


Thank you for taking the time :D
