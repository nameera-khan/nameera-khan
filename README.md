# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Nameera Nilofer Khan
- ðŸ‘€ I am a graduate in data science and artificial intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. 
-  My interest in data science had begun during the final year of my undergraduate degree, which consequently pushed me toward pursuing a career with a bigger picture. 
- ðŸŒ±  This is my portfolio for the projects I work on in my data science journey. I am learning to tell stories with data in all its glory.
- The repositories displayed on my profile are for the purpose of self-learning and also the ones I have worked on during my study.

Thank you for taking the time :D
